                        <p>
                    From popular shows like American Horror Story and The Walking Dead to haunted theme parks and scary Steven King novels, we crave all kinds of frightening experiences.
                    At the same time, fear is not exactly a positive emotion. Lying in bed and binging on It and It Chapter Two, trembling as the darkness pushes in around us — this is not a feeling we would describe as pleasant. Then, what is it about horror that humans are so drawn to? Moreover, why are some of us willing to spend our hard-earned money on a scare while others go great lengths to avoid it?</p>
                    </div>

            <div class="flextest">
               <div class="text2">

                <p>One reason we consume horror is to experience stimulation. Exposure to terrifying acts, or even the anticipation of those acts, can stimulate us — both mentally and physically — in opposing ways: negatively (in the form of fear or anxiety) or positively (in the form of excitement or joy). For instance, watching a horror video simultaneously activates both types of stimulation, 
                    with the most pleasure experienced at the most fearful moment. The biochemical inside our bodies also changes when we consume horror. Fright can trigger the release of adrenaline, resulting in heightened sensations and surging energy.

                <p>Lastly, horror entertainment may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche. After all, in real life, we might not have the opportunity to get to know a Hannibal Lecter or wander the streets during The Purge.
                     As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition. </p>

                    <p>We need to believe that we are physically safe — a safety frame. For example, although the evil entity in a movie might be committing terrifying acts in front of our eyes, we can derive pleasure from the horror as
                         long as we believe that the evil entity is physically distant from us and hence cannot cause harm to us. If, however, we start to believe that the evil entity is 
                         coming out of the screen to hurt us, then the experience will no longer be fun.</p></div>

                     <div class="group2">

                            <img src="images/SKULLS-03.jpg" alt="rs" style="width: 100%;"> </div>

                            <p>The second category of protective frame involves detachment — whether we can psychologically detach from a horror experience. When we see a psychotic murderer chasing down a bloodied victim in a film, 
                            we can activate psychological detachment by reminding ourselves that they are just actors, and great acting is what is happening on 
                            the screen.</p></div>

<br>
                        <p> The third category of protective frame involves our confidence in controlling and managing the dangers we encounter. If we visit a haunted house, for instance, and a realistic-looking, blood-thirsty zombie charges at us, we can still derive pleasure from the encounter if we feel confident about overcoming the danger.

                <p>Some research indicates that people with a higher sensation-seeking trait (i.e., a stronger need for experiencing thrill and excitement) tend to seek out and enjoy horror-related experiences more.
                 Those with a lower sensation-seeking trait may find those experiences unpleasant and avoid them. Relatedly, the trait of openness to experience (or the need to engage in imaginative activities) is also a predictor of horror consumption — a stronger openness to experience 
                trait is associated with increased affinity towards horror.

                <p>In addition, individual differences in empathy are associated with enjoyment of horror. Those who are not so empathic can enjoy horror more. This is because those with a higher level of empathy tend to feel more 
                    negatively about the distress situations others experience, like people being tormented by a devious murderer in a film.</p>

            <div class="text8"><p>Gender and age also appear to matter. One survey found that, on average, younger individuals tend to be more attracted to this scary genre; men are more likely to be fans of horror than women; and women versus men may like different aspects of a horror experience. 
                That is, women may enjoy a horror movie more when it offers a happy ending (e.g., the evil entity ends up destroyed), whereas men may enjoy a horror movie more when it is loaded with intensely terrifying acts.</p>
                <div class="br4" align="right"><hr></div>
        </p>

        <p>Lastly, through our research — which analyzed movie box office data of 82 countries — we discovered that the preference for consuming horror may 
            differ across the stages of economic development. We found that individuals from countries with a higher GDP per capita consumed horror movies to a
             greater extent, but the same pattern was not observed for other movie genres such as romance. The results of our subsequent studies suggest that 
             this pattern occurred because lacking financial resources can degrade the psychological protective frame needed for horror enjoyment.</p>
